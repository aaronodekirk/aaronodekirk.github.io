                            <p>Over the past few years Breakout EDU has taken the education world by storm. Many are probably already familiar with the concept, but for those not, it is an education version of the “Escape Rooms” now present in many cities. In those escape rooms, you pay to be locked inside a room with a group of friends, presented with a scenario/reason to escape, and are given a fixed amount of time to do so. The challenge level of each room varies, but the basic premise is problem solving, teamwork,  and collaboration. By engaging successfully as a team, you have a much higher chance of “escaping” than otherwise.</p>

                        <p>This past fall I took on an adventure I wasn’t sure either I or my kids would be ready for. I started a club for electronics and programming using an Arduino in middle school. If you’re not familiar an Arduino is a micro-controller with a programmable board and a variety of inputs and outputs. The challenge with an Arduino is that it doesn’t have a traditional operating system of any form, and relies completely upon the tinkerer to prototype and get everything set up appropriately. You have to know about voltages and I/O pins, and even a bit of programming to get one set up the right way. This is challenging for adults, much less middle school students, and yet it is possible. </p>

                        <p>Google sheets is a powerful tool and is very easy to use, once you are familiar with its syntax. This post will focus on how you can use 3 different statements, which should give a good starting point from which to grow. We will focus on =COUNTIF, COUNTIFS, and =QUERY. With these 3 statements you can begin to create powerful tools to quickly analyze and create meaningful data sets.</p>
