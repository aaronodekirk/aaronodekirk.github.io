               <h2>Welcome</h2>
               <p>Welcome to my website, here you will find a variety of resources I have created over the past several years, in addition to recommendations from other educators on a variety of resources. Each page of the website is designed to serve its own purpose depending on what you find most valuable, so instead of searching through many different links, you can head to the area you want right away. There is a link to a contact form on this page of the website. Please use this to reach out to me about feedback on this website or with other questions you may have.</p>
               <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p>For the past 3 years I have served as my school districts K-12 Technology Integration Instructional coach as a part of the State of Iowa’s Teacher Leadership and Compensation Program. My job is to work with teachers in reflective coaching cycles centered around technology and improving student outcomes in their classrooms by focusing on student work/actions and promoting teacher growth through reflection. For the past 2 years I have also taught a Computer Science course based on Harvard’s CS50 and CS50AP courses. My version of the class primarily focuses on the C and Python programming languages. I am not a traditionally trained Computer Scientist, and have a background in Social Studies education, but have learned quite a bit from a variety of trainings/professional learnings to teach the course. This spring (2018) I am working with a team and the Iowa Department of Education to review Computer Science standards working toward putting for a recommended set of standards for adoption in the state.</p>
               <p>I am passionate about bringing education out of the 19th century and into the 21st century. The world has changed drastically in even the last 10 years with the introduction of smartphones, much less over the past 100 years, yet if you walked into many classrooms today you would see some of the same practices, and even the same worksheets, that you yourself might have done, or worse, the same activities done by kids 100 years ago. I believe it is time for a change to prepare our students for a world that does not exist yet. We do this by looking critically at the work being asked of our students and whether it is aligned to standards, meets the needs for a 21st century workforce, and is appropriate for students at that grade/age level. One of the best ways to do this work is through reflective practice focused on looking at the student work and measuring what we did and whether it was successful or not, and if not, then what changes need to be put into place in order to get everyone to proficiency.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Over the past few years Breakout EDU has taken the education world by storm. Many are probably already familiar with the concept, but for those not, it is an education version of the “Escape Rooms” now present in many cities. In those escape rooms, you pay to be locked inside a room with a group of friends, presented with a scenario/reason to escape, and are given a fixed amount of time to do so. The challenge level of each room varies, but the basic premise is problem solving, teamwork,  and collaboration. By engaging successfully as a team, you have a much higher chance of “escaping” than otherwise. This theme fits well with education, however we usually frown upon locking kids inside of rooms with no adult supervision. So naturally, this activity has to change a little. My first experience with this came several years ago at a technology conference as we worked to escape a room, and quickly decided to bring it back to my school district. We started with 4 boxes, but it built another 2 to make it 6 and I have designed many games for teachers over the past 2.5 years. I decided to build the boxes myself because it was far cheaper than purchasing a kit, and have added on with locks and various game mechanisms since then.</p>
                            <p>There are quite a variety of games out there too look at on <a href="www.breakoutedu.com" target="_blank">www.breakoutedu.com</a>. I haven’t used many of these in the past because they are designed as a whole group activity, and with class sizes of 30+, I worry about what the other 25 students are doing while 5 work the problem. To get more kids engaged, we use more boxes and design our activities to fit those 6 boxes with smaller groups of kids. What I’ve seen is that it engages nearly all kids in the activity and makes it easier for groups to go at a pace that fits them. What many of the available online activities also miss, is a firm content piece. By its nature, when you’re trying to open a locked box, you are focused on opening the locks that close it, not on deeply learning a piece of content. To help this, the activities I design usually include an additional component to complete once the box is open. Since the box is open, the focus can shift to absorb new information to answer a question. In my experience, kids will continue to engage, even after the box is open. This can lead to challenges in how much time is available in a class. Typically I’ve found that it takes about 10 minutes to get everyone in and settled and the scenario led, and takes another few minutes for kids to orient themselves to the scenario. One of the biggest tips I have is that there need to be a variety of locks with a variety of challenges, and that all groups should have at least one lock off within 15-20 minutes (20 absolute max) of the scenario beginning. Any longer and groups start to get too frustrated and lose focus during the activity. I would be more than happy to help you get set up, just use the contact form on this website to get in touch.</p>

                            Arduino in the Classroom
                        </div>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>This past fall I took on an adventure I wasn’t sure either I or my kids would be ready for. I started a club for electronics and programming using an Arduino in middle school. If you’re not familiar an Arduino is a micro-controller with a programmable board and a variety of inputs and outputs. The challenge with an Arduino is that it doesn’t have a traditional operating system of any form, and relies completely upon the tinkerer to prototype and get everything set up appropriately. You have to know about voltages and I/O pins, and even a bit of programming to get one set up the right way. This is challenging for adults, much less middle school students. </p>
                            <p>As a club, we would only meet 1x each week for an hour after school during 10 sessions, which is not a lot to get familiar with the intricacies of the C++ programming language and electronics. We started by using Makey Makey’s which are a lite version of an arduino, you can still program them, but they are designed to be easy to use, plug and play. I would highly recommend them to get familiar with the fundamentals of electronics and microcontrollers. From there we used an online interface called Tinkercad, which has an electronics hub where you can prototype Arduino board layouts, and program them in an online environment. This hub made the club possible and allowed my kids to see their boards and work with them before putting them into action, and possible making a mistake that could burn out the board. </p>
                            <p>By the end of the club each group of students had made a “zombie-detection” system with a motion sensor, and alarm system that would light up if a tripwire was crossed. If you don’t have any knowledge about programming or microcontrollers I would encourage you to check out a makey makey and start there, and work up to an Arduino or more advanced board, and definitely check out Tinkercad as a resource, it is invaluable and has many tutorials and help videos to get started. What is also cool about them is they have a 3D design and modeling program online, where you can design a variety of items for 3D printing, or even minecraft. As always, if you have any questions about how this works, or how you could get this going please don’t hesitate to reach out and contact me using the form on this site.  Happy Coding!</p>

                    <div class="head">Google Sheets in the Classroom</div>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            Google sheets is a powerful tool and is very easy to use, once you are familiar with its syntax. This post will focus on how you can use 3 different statements, which should give a good starting point from which to grow. We will focus on =COUNTIF, COUNTIFS, and =QUERY
                        </p>
                        <h4>Example Table</h4>
                        <table>
                            <tr><td> </td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>1</td><td>mary</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>2</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>2</td><td>john</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>1</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>3</td><td>sally</td><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>0</td></tr>
                        </table>

                        <h4>=COUNTIF</h4>
                        <p>As with all sheet functions, we start with the ‘=’ sign, this lets the sheet know we have something coming that will format other pieces of data based on what is input. COUNTIF, allows us to select from a range, a count of the values that match a certain parameter.</p>
                        <p>In the table above: =countif(A1:A3,”mary”) would return 1, since there is only 1 entry with mary. What is important to notice is that “mary” has double quotation marks around it, this indicates a string, or sequence of character, values, instead of a number, date, or other value.</p>
                        <p>Similarly =countif(C1:C3,”B”), would return 2, since there are two values that contain B as an answer.</p>
                        <p>Let’s consider column D to contain the total number of correct and incorrect answers. =countif(D1:D3,&lt;2), would return a value of 2, since there are two entries that contain a value of less than 2. </p>
                        <p>The power of this statement is that it quickly allows you to count the number of values that match a particular search query/string. So if you were curious how many students answered one question a particular way or another, you would be able to easily calculate that number based on the responses that come in. This instead of you manually tabulating it yourself. Intervention just got a whole lot easier, especially if you have a cutoff.</p>
                        <h4>=COUNTIFS</h4>
                        <p>This function is very similar to the one above, but the difference is that it allows you to calculate the total number of values based upon multiple criteria and multiple ranges. It is structured very closely to the above example:</p>
                        <p>=countifs(B:B,”B”,D:D,”2”), this would return 2, since there is one value in column B with the value B, and one value in column D with the value 2. If you were to have related questions on a quick check quiz, you would be able to see how many students answered similarly, or would be able to count the number of students whose answers match two criteria on either different or the same row. You will notice I typed in B:B, instead of B1:B3, the difference is that in this example above I included ALL values in column B and D, not just B1-B3, so using specific notation is also important.</p>
                        <h4>=QUERY</h4>
                        <p>This is perhaps one of the most powerful tools and I will keep it simple for this post, but know there is a lot more it can do, let’s use an example.</p>
                        <p>=query(A:D,”select * where A = ‘mary’”), this will return all values in the sheet columns A - D where the name mary appears in column A, discluding all other values. If we replace the * with a column letter within the range A-D, you will return each of the values in that column where column A matches ‘mary’. The query selector  is valuable because it lets you quickly break down data based upon some kind of selection you want. If you had a running list of exit tickets in a single sheet, you would be able to return all the exit tickets of a particular student by putting in their name into the where A = ‘studentName’, portion. The QUERY is limited by the columns or range you select, in this case A:D, you could not for example. Say ‘select E where A = ‘mary’”), because column E was not included in the initial QUERY.</p>
                        <p>Notice that the QUERY string is enclosed in double quotations, this is mandatory, and notice also that mary has a single quotation mark around the name to indicate mary is a string value.</p>
                    <h4>What if my values are in a different sheet?</h4>
                        <p>Things start to get a little tricky, but lets say, for the sake of simplicity, that we want to run some formulas in a sheet tab called SHEET2, no spaces, and that our data lies in SHEET1, no spaces.</p>
                        <p>We would format our formula like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>=countif(SHEET1!A:D,”mary”), notice the sheet name is followed by an exclamation point, and then the range to search, with no spaces.</li>
                            <li>If a sheet does have a space in the name ,then you can enclose ite sheet name in a single/double quote, and then follow with the exclamation point like: =countif(“SHEET1”!A:D,”mary”). It is just far easier to have sheet names without spaces to make sure you get the data going where you want.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>There you have it, some quick and easy formulas, You can get even more powerful as you chain them together to do more and interesting things. Think if you wanted to query all students who had scored below a certain threshold on an exam, and then count how many of those students missed a single question or answered a certain way. You have the tools now to do that.</p>
                    <p>As always, if you have an questions about formatting or would like help with these formulas or setting up more advanced ones, please don’t hesitate to reach out and I will be more than happy to help.</p>
