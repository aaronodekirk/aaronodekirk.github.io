                    </a>
                    <p>A freemium service that allows you to quickly create assessments with a variety of question types, including math equations, and including video/images as well. You get instant access to sores from students and can connect with your google drive for easy exporting. Socrative does have a game mode similar to other resources where students can either team up or compete individually.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>A freemium polling service that allows respondents to respond to polls anonymously on the free tier, or non-anonymously on a paid tier. You can respond via text, twitter, or the web depending on how the poll is set up. A downside is that items are not graded like socrative, but does offer a variety of presentation formats for results depending on what you would like. A huge plus is an integration with Google Slides, so you can launch a poll from a presentation without leaving it.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>Forms has mostly been used to collect feedback but at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year it included Quizzes, which quickly let teachers collect assessment information from students and does include an auto-grading feature that makes it easy to see where students are. A downside is that it doesn’t include a game mode like other services, but as a G Suite core service, it does “play well” with other google services and makes it easy to export spreadsheets to your drive. Another advantage is the inclusion with Google Classroom.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>Kahoot is another service where you can ask a variety of multiple choice answers, but is chiefly a game mode. The music and colors can be a bit distracting, so be prepared the first time it is used with students for them to be distracted and will need so front-loading to get ready. A huge advantage is the ability to click on answers by color or symbol for younger students, who may not be able to read yet. If they know their shapes or colors they can respond that way. Personally, I recommend Kahoot! For younger grades and then a more mature service for older students that also may have game elements.

                        <p>Google Connected Classrooms is a community of educators who work to find connections between each other for different purposes. At the Elementary Level it is a good platform to find another classroom for a “Mystery Number” activity, or to form connections with educators across the world. The community is dedicated to connecting educators from all different places on the globe.</p>

                        <p>Today’s meet is a good forum through which to ask questions about a meeting or topics for a class session. It is a paid service and there are more features on higher tiered levels than on the free level, but is a good way to quickly get ideas out into the room or provide a forum to ask questions asynchronously during a lesson without breaking stride during teaching.</p>

                        <p>Many educators are already familiar with Prezi, and it is a neat presentation service that makes it easy to add interesting transitions and points of emphasis within a presentation. My personal hesitation with using Prezi is that very often more time is spent looking at transitions that don’t add a whole lot to the content or substance of a presentation, rather than looking at ways the flow of the Prezi enhances the content. More often than not, the Prezi can draw attention away from the content of the presentation, or is used as a crutch to support a presentation, rather than one that enhances it. That said, done the right way, Prezi can bring powerful transitions and points of emphasis to drive home a point, the speaker just needs to know what that point is first.</p>

                        <p>Another freemium service, but one that allows for video editing, and so long as you are comfortable with a small watermark on the page, it does let you do interesting things with video on a tight or non-existent budget. What is a huge plus is that it works on Chromebooks, albeit a bit slower than on a desktop. This lets students get into the finer aspects of video editing while keeping a schools budget small. They do also offer school wide site plans, in addition to individual licenses. Our school has used this tool multiple times at different levels, and the inclusion of both an “easy” and “advanced” mode, gives entry points for students at all levels.</p>

                        <h3>Screencastify <img src="images/work.png" class="ico" alt="work icon"></h3>
                        <p>Screencastify is another in a suite of options available as chrome extensions that allow you to capture your desktop and record screencasts. As a tiered service, the lowest tier allows you to record screen casts of up to 10 minutes. The service does integrate with your Google Drive, making it easy to record information for later use, and a 10 minute max is enough for nearly all purposes. This utility does work on Chromebooks, giving it a leg up on other services that only work on Mac/Windows/Linux PC’s.</p>

                        <p>A strong password is a good password, but one problem is the stronger they are the more difficult they are to remember. Services like LastPass exist in many forms, but the premise is that by remembering 1 long difficult password as a “key” the service will store, create, and automatically re-create, passwords for other services. While I wouldn’t use it for a bank account, it does help prevent reuse of old passwords and will warn you about sites where you have previously done so.</p>

                        <p>Up until recently this was a paid service but has now gone free. Read&Write for Google provides a wealth of tools for struggling readers, from highlighting text to providing a visual dictionary for words on websites students don’t understand. It does provide text to speech reading as well. To get a free account, teachers just need to sign up with a school email and provide some minor information about their district. There is also some support for other languages, helping students who are working to become proficient in English.</p>

                        <p>Draftback is an extension for Chrome that works in Google Docs. It lets you review the revision history of a Google Doc, seeing in real time how it was written. The addon also lets you view statistics about the document during writing, such as where in the document writing was taking place, and how long/how many writing sessions there were. This tool is useful for students to look at their writing style and whether they are revising their work in multiple sittings. It also works as a plagiarism checker as copy/pasted code jumps into view without writing. It isn’t 100% reliable because it could be copied from another document, but does provide insight.</p>

Some courses offer Verified Certificates for a fee, and others even offer university credit depending on the level of rigor required. Those that do offer certificates or for credit often require completing activities by specific deadlines, but most courses are open for audit. I highly recommend the platform for diving into different topics on your own time.</p>

Google Arts and culture contains thousands of images and artwork from around the world including artwork of many different types and varieties. Each piece of art also contains information about the piece and its place in history. Artwork can be organized by color, time, theme, which helps students draw connections between different pieces as they study how art developed over time or how the artist represented their experience.</p>

This is a huge advantage as it becomes possible to visit many different places around the world and see them as if you were there. As an experiment I have traveled the streets virtually of many places including a study abroad experience I had in college, and it was very profound to be there once again, and also to experience it in VR. As with other VR experiences, care should be taken for those who get motion sickness.</p>

                        <p>Similar to the Street View utility mentioned elsewhere, but specifically designed for the classroom, Expeditions are carefully curated and designed virtual field trips for students to go on with their teacher. There are hundreds of available expeditions for classrooms with cell phones and other devices. The Expeditions app works both in and out of a VR headset. Participants in the expedition connect along the same WiFi network with the leader of the expedition who guides from one step to the next. We are lucky enough to have an Expeditions Kit in our district, but other districts have put their own together by asking the community for older cell phone donations. One caution is that the phone must have a gyroscope inside of it in order to work with the Expeditions App, but otherwise most devices will work well. Make sure to download the expedition before beginning as some of them are quite large in file size. Once you have the devices and VR kits, the actual expeditions are available for free.</p>

                        <p>NewsELA is a fantastic service that provides tiered readings on a large variety of news topics. We all have students at different reading levels in our classrooms, but sometimes it can be challenging to find articles that match everyone’s ability and provide the same content. NewsELA does that for you. Once you find an article of interest you can adjust the reading level while not changing the substance of the article itself, matching the ability of students without compromising the content. </p>

                        <h3>WikiPedia Simple English<img src="images/other.png" class='ico' alt="other icon"></h3>
                        <p>WikiPedia is often a good place to start research, not as an only source, but as a good starting point. Sometimes the language being used can be above the reading level of our students or even ourselves.  A little known tool is the option for a simple english language. On the left side of a WikiPedia article where there are options to translate to different languages, you can click an option to see more languages, and among them is simple English. Like NewsELA, this changes the reading level of the page while working to not sacrifice on the content. Simple English is not available for everything but is worth checking out as a resource.</p>

                        <p>Awesome Tables makes visualizing data with Google Sheets very easy through its online utility. As it becomes more and more popular with schools and businesses around the globe, some features have become a premium service requiring payment, but for simple visualizations it is hard to beat. There is a great community and documentation helping to understand how to format a sheet once information is configured correctly. Resources are given to embed into external website as well. I would highly recommend for anyone looking to quickly visualize their data and make meaning without the tedium of number-crunching and manually configuring tables in a google sheet.</p>

                        <p>Airtable is a combination spreadsheet and database that continues to grow in popularity. I use it in my classroom for students to continuously push updates to their projects, and for me to provide feedback. What is fantastic is there are different views for the same data. You can view data as cards, on a calendar, as Trello style tables, or as a traditional spreadsheet view. Airtable also integrates with a variety of different services to make importing data easy and intuitive. I don’t expect Airtable to remain free with the amount of services on that Tier for very long, so would recommend setting up an account if you are even slightly interested in using the tool for organization.</p>

                        <p>Wouldn’t it be nice of Google Slides including polling or slide formats where you could gather formative feedback from your audience. Pear Deck integrates with Slides, to give you this option. It is an external service that can save to your Google Drive and does have both free and paid tiers. What separates Pear Deck from PollEverywhere is the inclusion of question types that let you draw a response. There is an Addon for Slides now that lets you import into a Google Slide from Pear Deck itself. The inclusion of different question types and drawing also makes it easier to use at younger grade levels than a tool like Poll Everywhere. For example, you could have kids draw a letter they are learning about and use that as a way to gather information about where they are at in letter/number recognition.</p>
