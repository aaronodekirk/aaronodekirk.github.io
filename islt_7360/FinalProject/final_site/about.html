            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>Equitable access to quality instruction through the integration of technology and computer science principles for all students.</p>
            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>For the past 3 years I have served as my school districts K-12 Technology Integration Instructional coach as a part of the State of Iowa’s Teacher Leadership and Compensation Program. My job is to work with teachers in reflective coaching cycles centered around technology and improving student outcomes in their classrooms by focusing on student work/actions and promoting teacher growth through reflection. For the past 2 years I have also taught a Computer Science course based on Harvard’s CS50 and CS50AP courses. My version of the class primarily focuses on the C and Python programming languages. I am not a traditionally trained Computer Scientist, and have a background in Social Studies education, but have learned quite a bit from a variety of trainings/professional learnings to teach the course. This spring (2018) I am working with a team and the Iowa Department of Education to review Computer Science standards working toward putting for a recommended set of standards for adoption in the state.</p>
               <p>I am passionate about bringing education out of the 19th century and into the 21st century. The world has changed drastically in even the last 10 years with the introduction of smartphones, much less over the past 100 years, yet if you walked into many classrooms today you would see some of the same practices, and even the same worksheets, that you yourself might have done, or worse, the same activities done by kids 100 years ago. I believe it is time for a change to prepare our students for a world that does not exist yet. We do this by looking critically at the work being asked of our students and whether it is aligned to standards, meets the needs for a 21st century workforce, and is appropriate for students at that grade/age level. One of the best ways to do this work is through reflective practice focused on looking at the student work and measuring what we did and whether it was successful or not, and if not, then what changes need to be put into place in order to get everyone to proficiency.</p>
