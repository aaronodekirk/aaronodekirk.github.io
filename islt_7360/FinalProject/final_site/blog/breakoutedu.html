                <p>Over the past few years Breakout EDU has taken the education world by storm. Many are probably already familiar with the concept, but for those not, it is an education version of the “Escape Rooms” now present in many cities. In those escape rooms, you pay to be locked inside a room with a group of friends, presented with a scenario/reason to escape, and are given a fixed amount of time to do so. The challenge level of each room varies, but the basic premise is problem solving, teamwork,  and collaboration. By engaging successfully as a team, you have a much higher chance of “escaping” than otherwise. This theme fits well with education, however we usually frown upon locking kids inside of rooms with no adult supervision. So naturally, this activity has to change a little. My first experience with this came several years ago at a technology conference as we worked to escape a room, and quickly decided to bring it back to my school district. We started with 4 boxes, but it built another 2 to make it 6 and I have designed many games for teachers over the past 2.5 years. I decided to build the boxes myself because it was far cheaper than purchasing a kit, and have added on with locks and various game mechanisms since then.</p>
                <p>There are quite a variety of games out there too look at on <a href="www.breakoutedu.com" target="_blank">www.breakoutedu.com</a>. I haven’t used many of these in the past because they are designed as a whole group activity, and with class sizes of 30+, I worry about what the other 25 students are doing while 5 work the problem. To get more kids engaged, we use more boxes and design our activities to fit those 6 boxes with smaller groups of kids. What I’ve seen is that it engages nearly all kids in the activity and makes it easier for groups to go at a pace that fits them. What many of the available online activities also miss, is a firm content piece. By its nature, when you’re trying to open a locked box, you are focused on opening the locks that close it, not on deeply learning a piece of content. To help this, the activities I design usually include an additional component to complete once the box is open. Since the box is open, the focus can shift to absorb new information to answer a question. In my experience, kids will continue to engage, even after the box is open. This can lead to challenges in how much time is available in a class. Typically I’ve found that it takes about 10 minutes to get everyone in and settled and the scenario led, and takes another few minutes for kids to orient themselves to the scenario. One of the biggest tips I have is that there need to be a variety of locks with a variety of challenges, and that all groups should have at least one lock off within 15-20 minutes (20 absolute max) of the scenario beginning. Any longer and groups start to get too frustrated and lose focus during the activity. I would be more than happy to help you get set up, just use the contact form on this website to get in touch.</p>
