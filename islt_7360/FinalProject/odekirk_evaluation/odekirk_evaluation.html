            <h1>Peer Feedback</h1>
            <h2>Via Hannah Johnson</h2>
            <p>I absolutely LOVE this. As a teacher myself, I find this website EXTREMELY helpful. I love how you have it organized. I think it's very user-friendly. I do have a couple of suggestions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Underneath your main navigation, maybe make a sub-navigation for each page. That way, users can quickly jump to a header. </li>
                <li>I wouldn't add a lot of images, but I think your home page could use some. Maybe an image for the "Welcome" and "About Me" sections?</li>
                <li>If you plan on continuing your blog posts, I would add a sub-navigation or index of blog posts directly to the left underneath the blue section header bar. It could float left and be used as an easy way to jump to a blog post that looks interesting. Also, I notice the first one is about BreakoutEdu, which you provide resources for on the site. Could you make sure to link any blog posts with where you share the resources elsewhere on your site? That way, when I'm reading about it, I could quickly jump to where you share those resources and tools.</li>
                <li>I think each section should have a "Return to Top" link or something that helps me jump back to the top quickly. It could be right above each blue section bar. Or, maybe you could make a "fixed" link that stays in place at the bottom as you scroll down the page. </li>
                <li>I love how the resources are divided into sections with image icons. Again, it might be nice to have an index of resources alphabetically or a sub-navigation at the top to quickly jump to a section.The "cards" look nice, but the paragraph descriptions are a little wordy. Is there a way to break it into bullet points? Something like
                    <ul>
                        <li>What it is in a nutshell: </li>
                        <li>Possible Uses: </li>
                        <li>Benefits: </li>
                        <li>Drawbacks: </li>
                        <li>Cost: </li>
                        <li>Similar to: / Use this if you like: </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All in all, I think this has the potential to become a very useful site. I am definitely bookmarking your page to use in my own classroom! Some resources I've heard of before, but it seems like there are a lot of new ones out there I haven't heard of before. </p>

        <h1>Evaluator Summary</h1>
            <h2>Evaluation Process</h2>
            <p>None of my evaluators are developers so some had difficult with a few of the questions, but we attempted to implement the form as presented. For each person we went through the form together and discussed the scores for each component. I indicated the score they thought it merited by highlighting the table-cell. Then after each section I asked them to provide feedback as a “narrative”, for which I took notes under each section.</p>
            <h2>Amanda Becker</h2>
            <p>Amanda is a Middle School Instructional Coach in a role similar to mine, however not with a focus on technology. She works with teachers through reflective coaching cycles to help raise student achievement and promote teacher growth. Through that work they often find themselves looking for resources and recommendations for other resources. I asked her if she would be willing to provide feedback on my website and evaluate whether or not it would fit her needs. Amanda used an HP laptop running Windows 7 and evaluated the website using Chrome version 65 over a WiFi network.</p>
            <p>The biggest feedback I received from Amanda was that the basic layout and structure of my website was good, however some tweaks were needed to make it more user friendly. For example, she was unsure what purpose the images served on the different cards on the recommendations page, since all of them were the same for each section. Amanda also mentioned that it would be better to include dates on each blog post to help the viewer know how current the website was. She also mentioned the text was very small and cramped on the site overall. She also stated it would be good to include the contact form on the website itself, rather than redirecting the user to a different page.</p>

            <h2>Emily Whitehead</h2>
            <p>Emily is a high school social studies teacher, and someone who has held a position to mine in the past. As a current teacher she often looks for resources, and as someone with a similar role to mine, I thought her feedback would be very beneficial as I build resources to target other teachers like her. We tested the website on an HP 14 G4 Chromebook running the ChromeOS version 65. This browser is also similar to what other teachers and students are using around the country, since Chromebooks are significantly cheaper than traditional laptops.</p>
            <p>The biggest issue Emily commented on was the amount of “clutter” on the website and content that appeared on the screen. She mentioned it was overwhelming to be presented with that much text at first, and that in order for it to be a useful website for her, it should have a cleaner first impression. She liked that the header scrolled with the page, but wondered if it would be possible for only the navigation element to scroll to prevent a large part of the screen being taken up by the header element. She also thought that my site needed to do a better job of making it unique or standing out from the crowd, since many other websites already contain information similar to mine, it needs a better hook. To help reduce clutter Emily suggested I create a different page on the website for About me, instead of having it as a “wall of text” on the home page, I could then include a resume or job history there.</p>

            <h2>Allison Emery</h2>
            <p>Allison is a high school instructional coach in a role similar to Amanda. She works primarily with high school teachers, but is also a program facilitator, which means she also works more with district administrators and other “higher-up” personnel. Through her work she finds herself looking for resources with teachers and administrators, and often it can be difficult to find the resource they are looking for. We tested the website on a Microsoft Surface Book running the Windows 10 Operating System and the Microsoft Edge browser version 40.</p>
            <p>I had not originally tested my website on the Edge browser, and we encountered an interesting glitch when testing. On other browsers the sticky header element scrolled with the page as intended, but on the Edge browser we encountered a flickering effect which was distracting for the user when they scrolled. Allison also mentioned that each of the cards contained too much information and that having to scroll through each card on the resources page or the breakout page made it difficult to navigate and use the website. She recommended using each card to provide a snapshot of the information, but not to include it all on the card itself, this would prevent scrolling on the website. Like my other reviewers she also mentioned the cramped feeling on parts of the website and also wondered about whether the contact form could be included in more places on the website, not just its own page. She did recommend moving the contact form to its own page in the website, rather than having it redirect to an external website.</p>

            <h1>Use Cases</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>A 1:1 Initiative</li>
                <li>Google for EDU Resources</li>
                <li>Presentation Resources</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of the three use cases I outlined in my design document was addressed in my pilot website, most specifically in the Resources page of the website. Perhaps the element that wasn’t addressed directly was a separate section for Presentation Resources. I did not include a separate section for this in the Resources because I did not want to make the website to extensive on the amount of text on each page. Evaluator feedback indicated my website was strong on the content of the website with an average score of 4.10. The lowest scores were for credibility and for text ease of reading, which was a common theme among all evaluators.</p>
            <p>By far the most common suggestion was to decrease the amount of “clutter” and “walls of text” effects on the website. The evaluators mentioned that immediately when users get ot the website they see a bunch of text without a clear purpose, and that cleaning that section up or moving to another place would be a good idea. They also mentioned that some of the cards were difficult to use because of scrolling within the card itself. They suggested using the card to show a snippet of information that could be linked elsewhere in the site for more detailed information to keep the users focus.</p>

            <h1>Recommend/Planned Changes</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Reduce the amount of text in each card to reduce scrolling within cards themselves.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Consistently evaluators mentioned the amount and size of text on each page to be overwhelming. To help alleviate this issue I will use each card on the primary resources page as a highlight of the information, but clicking will take the user to a sub-page of the Resources page that includes more information about that and other resources. This will let me include relevant information, but reduce clutter

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Increase spacing between font letters and font size of paragraph text on the website
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This is paired with the change in number 1, and also addresses the same concerns by users. Initially I didn’t increase font size of &lt;p&gt; elements to prevent the website from being too log vertically, however that created a new issue. This fix will aim to alleviate that.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Increase the size of the header element to take up more of the landing page
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            My evaluators also mentioned a need to increase “branding” to make the website more representative of me and not as generic in places. To do this I will increase the size of the header element on the landing page to give users a cleaner view that lets them know where they are and to increase branding. I will also move some parts of the About Me into a Mission and Purpose statement on the resume page.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Place published date in blog posts
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This is a simple change and addresses concerns from evaluators that information about how current the website is was not easily available. It was noticed in the footer section, but they mentioned that placing a “last-updated” element of the blog posts would help visitors know how often I am posting information.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Create a new page for “blog archives” will only have the three of the pilot page initially.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This should be fairly easy to implement and for the time being will only include the 3 posts on the Pilot Page, but over time could grow to include all posts. This will give users a way to view previous information, without cluttering up and increasing the vertical length of the main page with each subsequent post. This is also more consistent with other blog pages around the internet.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Implement Contact form into the site itself instead of a redirect
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I am currently using a Google Form for contact information, which also has an easy embed function, so moving the form into its own page on the website should be straightforward. Evaluators mentioned that moving the contact page into the website itself would also help keep them on the same page and continue looking around after they place a contact form. It would also help keep branding consistent.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Place more links to contact throughout the website
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This is paired with number 6 from above. Fairly consistently, evaluators mentioned a need to make contacting me more obvious and easier, especially for resources where I am unable to provide a direct link due to student privacy concerns. My plan is to indicate to users that they should contact me for those resources and provide a link to the newly created page from step 6 of my overall changes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Images
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Users did mention uncertainty around images on the website and their purpose, or a lack of clarity. My intention is to implement using JavaScript or JQuery a search and filter function after this course is over. Having a search and filter ability will let users quickly find information about grade level and other items which could be different across different sections of the Recommendations page. For example one resource in the Collaboration section could be appropriate for Elementary aged students, and another resource in the Recommendations page could also be appropriate for elementary aged students. Once implemented, the images will help users understand the primary purpose of that resource when the filter is put in place. Due to this planned feature, I will not be making that change at this time based on my evaluators feedback.

            <h1>Reflection on Evaluation Process</h1>
            <p>The evaluation process was useful for my development process and gave me insight into how users who would be visiting my page found its implementation. One thing they struggled with on the evaluation form was the question about images providing an alt and width/height items. As non-developers they weren’t sure how to answer those more technical questions and provided more information based on the content and the design of the website, vs. more technical components. However, I think this still provide useful information as I was able to interpret their impressions about the site and transfer them into how I could implement developmental changes that would affect their experience. I hadn’t realized how cluttered the site could seem on my own viewing, so getting this information from my testers was invaluable, and makes me further consider how much information I include. Naturally, I am someone who prefers as much information in as little space as possible and prefer condensed views, however this was not preferred by my testers. Their feedback has caused me to re-evaluate how I design different pages of the website to keep viewers focused on the page and the information I truly want them to focus on.</p>
            <p>I also thought I had done the right thing by making the header bar scroll with the page, however viewer feedback indicated this was not as desired on the website, and that increasing “brading” and presence was more important for their experience. My new thinking is to clean up the main landing page of the website to include less information in the initial view and to draw users in by having them immediately presented with a clean and consistent view, that gives them enough information to be interested and keep scrolling, but not too much information that they are turned off by the site. My current view, as indicated by my evaluators, includes too much information, in too small a section of page.</p>
            <p>As a whole, I think the evaluation process was vital to the development of my webpage to gain multiple perspectives. Too often we box ourselves in to our own world-view and projects so that we tend to not think of, or possibly ignore other perspectives because they do not match our own. Having others who are different from me evaluate my perspective allowed me to see my site from another persons point of view. The goal for my site is for it to be as useful as possible to as wide an audience as possible, so having people from a variety of roles within education served an important purpose.</p>
