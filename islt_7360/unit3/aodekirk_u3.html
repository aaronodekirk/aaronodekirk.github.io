        <h3>TOPIC 1: </h3>
        <p>An important item to include in my final website is a resume and portfolio of my work. I have taken the first steps at creating an html file for my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>. Some personal elements, such as my address and phone number have not yet been added, but will be relatively simple to do at a later date. </p>
        <p>On this page I am including a header element that travels with the page as the user scrolls. Including this will make it easier for users to access additional pages of my website, without scrolling back up to the top. My current plan is to include this header on every page to ensure consistency for a users experience. I've also plan on setting the header to remove the anchor tag for the current page to help further indicate the users location on the website.</p>
        <p>Currently the resume page links back to this page through the About Me at the top. I am not sold on this navigation or on the titles of the pages themselves but have it in place as I begin to work on the layout of my website.</p>

        <h3>TOPIC 2: </h3>
        <p>Another important topic/component of my website will be to include a list of resource I have created throughout my job. I am uncertain as of yet where they should go in the website, however am leaning towards placing them within the <em>My Portfolio</em>.</p>
        <p>
            I am including an example below in an unordered list of hyperlinks to each doc. Most of these were created using <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" target="_blank">GSuite</a> resources for my school.

        <h3>Topic 3:</h3>
        <p>The main purpose of the landing page for my website will be to highlight my professional work and provide links to the sub-pages of the website. I am leaning towards the main page being more of a highlight/overview for the rest of the site. While looking at other resources similar to mine I find myself drawn more to websites with a clean front page that directs the user from there, without a lot of additional information. Put another way, and knowing that users tend to scan vs. read content, I would like my websites landing page to guide users without having them scroll through walls of text.</p>
