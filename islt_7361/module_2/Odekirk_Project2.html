    <h1>Odekirk Project 2: Digital Audio</h1>
    <h2>Introduction and Learning Objectives</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This project extends my previous one and builds toward my final. Once we understand fundamental components of a computer it is important for us to understand why we use 1's and 0's to represent fundamental pieces of all information on a computer.
        This audio file seeks to inform the user one of the reasons as to why we use binary or bits to represent information instead of something more comfortable like base 10.</p>
    <h3>Script</h3>
    <p>So you know by now that we use 1’s and 0’s in computing to store and retrieve information. But why 1’s and 0’s. Why only two options? Surely it would be better to have more than 2. 3 options would allow for something between true and false. And base
        10 would let us do math the same way as the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>There are a number of answers but a predominant one comes down to voltage and current. So let’s consider a lightswitch. We’ll consider turning the light on a 1 and off a 0. There are two possible energy states on or off. If you were trying to measure
        this objectively it would be fairly easy to know when the lightbulb is on or off. There is little question.</p>
    <p>But Let’s say we try to add a 3rd state, somewhere in between. Again we could probably measure this but we’re more likely to make a mistake. Let’s add a 4th state, now we’re almost definitely going to be making mistakes trying to figure out what brightness
        setting we’re in. What about 10. Imagine trying to pick accurately 100% of the time between 10 different brightness settings. It is almost infinitely more challenging than simply between 1 and 0, where we’re almost certain to not make a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>This example illustrates why we use 1 and 0 in a computer. Since we use electricity and the state of something having more states makes in increasingly more likely to make a mistake. Sure we’d like to wake up with an extra million in our bank account,
        but we would be up in arms if our bank account got zeroed out. This would be almost a certainty when dealing with large amounts of data.
    </p>
    <p>So, at the end of the day having 2 states, on or off, makes it far far less likely we will make an error. Thus we have bits as 1 or 0.</p>

    <h3>Learning Objective</h3>
    <p>Students will be able to recall and discuss why we use bits of 1 and 0 in computing</p>

    <h2>Licensing</h2>
    <p>Audio was obtained under CC 4.0 from:<br> Noel Griffin Music. "Hybrid Circuit." <em>Noel Griffin</em>, noelgriffinmusic.com/music. Obtained on 9/19/2018</p>
    <h2>Techniques</h2>
    <p>Audio was created using Audacity editor. The following techniques were applied:
        <ul>
            <li>Manual muting of breaths taken before speaking</li>
            <li>Normalization of spoken track effect</li>
            <li>Equalization of spoken track effect</li>
            <li>Clipping of obtained audio to fit 90 second audio file</li>
            <li>~2 second fade-in and out on obtained audio file</li>
            <li>Split obtained audio to 5 tracks to manually reduce decibel level to keep music at reduced volume</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Through a variety of experiences in my life I've had a decent amount of experience creating digital audio files for a variety of purposes, and am already pretty familiar with the Audacity program, which made this project a bit easier. The most challenging
        part of this was keeping the audio at the 90 second mark. I could have made it a bit longer, but I think there is value in keeping a topic as complex as this as concise as possible. I tend to be a person who expands on their thinking so writing
        a script was very important for my final product. I am fairly pleased with the end result and think the use of electic style instrumental music fits the theme of the video. When beginning this project I had some concern about finding an audio
        track to fit the theme of the video that didn't sound too generic or out of place, but was able to find an artist who licenses material under CC 4.0. This licensing was usefull because I did have to trim the audio and then split it into 5 tracks
        to manually adjust the volume to keep the rise in the music to levels that did not distract from my speaking.</p>
    <p>I think a topic like this is useful to talk about without visual distractions, since it is a fairly abstract concept. Diving any deeper into the topic would require a video with an oscilloscope to visualize the different current electric states, but
        that would be beyond the scope of most courses I teach. Though it was challenging for me to keep the audio below the 90 second mark, I also think this is beneficial to keep the listeners attention span.</p>
    <p>In terms of my final project this audio clip is useful because it helps students begin to understand why computers work the way they do. My first project focused on identifying basic components, and now we are getting toward why we structure computers
        and information the way we do. In my final project students will work on identifying basic data-types and an important component of that is understanding the size of different data-types. We refer to the size by bits and bytes, so understanding
        what a bit is and why we use it instead of something else is beneficial to help conceptualize asbtract information.</p>
