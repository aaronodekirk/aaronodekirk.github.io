    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Aaron Odekirk. I currently live in Ames, Iowa and work as a Technology Integration Instructional Coach in the Fort Dodge community school district. My job is to work with teachers to help integrate technology into their work with students. I also teach an introductory computer science class at our HS one trimester out of the year.</p>
    <p>I began working on my MS in Learning Design and Technology this past winter to grow my skills for my current position and the future. I'm fairly confident in my ability to program websites and small web apps, but am less confident when it comes to adding style and piecing various components together. I'm hoping this course will help with the design side of my skill-set to give my audience a more cohesive view on things I create.</p>
