    <h1>Odekirk Project 3: Digital Video</h1>
    <h2>Introduction and Learning Objectives</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This project extends my previous one and builds toward my final. At this point, students should know why we use 1's and 0's and the basic components of a computer. This project brings that information together and helps students understand how the different components of a computer interact withe eachother and how information is transferred from one basic component to another. At this point the actual information is fairly abstract, and the purpose is to understand the basics of interaction between components.</p>

    <h3>Learning Objective</h3>
    <p>Students will be able to recall and discuss how basic components of a computer interact.</p>

    <h2>Techniques</h2>
    <p>Video was created using Adobe Premier Software. The following techniques were applied:
    <h3>Shots</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mid-shot: This shot was taken with me for the introduction and conclusion of the video.</li>
        <li>POV shot: This shot was taken top down as if the viewer is looking at the computer themselves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Angles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eye-Level: This shot was taken with the mid-shot for the introduction</li>
        <li>Top-angle: This shot was taken top down on the main portion of the video looking down on the computer. This is in conjunction with the POV shot</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Motion</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Zoom in/out: For each segment of the main clip the video zooms in on the component being discussed and then zooms back out to the main board.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Transitions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dissolve: The dissolve effect happens at the end of the transitioning to the credits screen.</li>
        <li>Page Turn: This effect takes place transitioning from the opening credits to the shot of me. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Green Screen: A green screen was used during the filming of this video to minimize distractions for students during the video.</li>
        <li>Voice-over narration was used during the top-angle shot as a sub audio layer.</li>
        <li>Background music occurs during the length of the video with audio levels being adjusted throughout to remain in the background.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>The most difficult part of this process was deciding on angles and how I would shoot the video. I found myself making a few changes from my initial vision, such as using a green screen effect during filming. I also found it difficult to keep the length of the video to 90 seconds. Perhaps if each component had been done separately it would have been possible, but my goal was to hit each of the major components and how they interact. </p>
    <p>I've done some video editing before with other software so the editing portion wasn't as difficult as I had first anticipated. The bulk of the processing work came down to making sure my timing was accurate and that the layers were placed appropriately at the correct time to fit with the video. Since I've done some editing before I had an idea of how much time it could take, so I gave myself plenty of time to spare for editing to make sure the end product fit my vision.</p>
    <p>For quick videos and recaps of lessons I don't think it is necessary to go through an extensive editing process, where a simple screen-cast would suffice. However for videos like mine and those explanining complex topics, I think an editing process with shots and transitions will be beneficial for students to help grow their understanding and keep them engaged throughout the video.</p>
