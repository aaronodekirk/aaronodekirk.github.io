    <h2>Introduction and Learning Objective</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this image is to introduce students to the fundametal components of a computer. As we transition to talking about data types and how they interact with a computer it is essential students understand the basic components of a computer and microcontroller.</p>
    <h3>Learning Objective</h3>
    <p>Understand and describe the basic components of computers and micro-controllers</p>
    <h2>Original File Links & Licensing</h2>
    <p>The PSD files were difficult to capture and went through several revisions during this project. I initially attempted to use the VPN service to remove in to MU and use Photoshop on the servers. This proved to be too difficult due to constraints on the computers and my internet connection. After installing photoshop on my own device several of my PSD files were corrupted after saving and did not open. Due to this I am attaching a screenshot with some layers in case the PSD does not open correctly.

            <ul>
                <li>Removed large amounts of clutter using Lasso Tool in both captured images</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use Smart Filters
            <ul>
                <li>Used filters to adjust image quality and sharpness</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>More Advanced Raster Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the brush tool to fine-tune a selection
            <ul>
                <li>Used brush tool on captured computer image to remove a cord and fine tune the selection</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Remove small objects
            <ul>
                <li>Removed small clutter from both images</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Remove a large object
            <ul>
                <li>Removed and masked a large cord in the computer image and other clutter from the original</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Apply your own filters without gallery or smart tools
            <ul>
                <li>After applying smart filters manually applied filters for Sharpness, Contrast, Brightness.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <ul>Image includes multiple arros pointing to each basic component of a computer and microcontroller</ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>More Advanced Vector Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reshape Text
            <ul>
                <li>Reshaped the text on the images from standard font sizes to better fit the page</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Edit paths and shapes
            <ul>
                <li>Edited initial shapes to better fit the image, and altered paths to form circular shapes from squares</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use paths and curves
            <ul>
                <li>Used paths and curves to place arrows onto shape paths and join the artwork together.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Design Elements</h2>
    <h3>Contrast</h3>
    <p>The image employs contrast in each side of the image and is meant to either be a 2 sided page or a single image to keep the viewer focused on one side at a time. A 2-tone color scheme is employed to keep high contrast between elements and the image simple.</p>
    <h3>Repetition</h3>
    <p>The image repeats styling and placement of numbers and text from one element to another. Each side of the image is repeated to keep the visuals similar to one another.</p>
    <h3>Alignment</h3>
    <p>Numbers and text on the image are consistently aligned with eachother both within an individual side of the image as well as across the whole image. Each number and paragraph descriptor are aligned with eachother horizontally and vertically.</p>
    <h3>Proximity</h3>
    <p>Text and number headers are kept in close proximity to eachother and the image attempts to keep the viewer focsed on each side with the above elements without being too spread out.</p>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project proved to be challenging for me. When I proposed my final project I was hoping to create digital media to support my students learning more about fundamental data types in Computer Science, however this was challenging to expand on in this project, because it would be extremely difficult for me to capture images of these data-types without highly advanced imaging devices available to see them in action on a stick of RAM. Due to this, I went with identifying the fundamental components of a computer, which is related and important for students and far easier to capture images of.</p>
    <p>I also encountered challenges, as mentioned above, with the Adobe software not saving my PSD files correctly, which required me to re-do my work several times. I was also disconnected mid-session from the MU server when using that software, which meant I lost my work. There was a steep learning curve to the software, but it did become quite easier once I had figured out how to navigate the different tools.</p>
    <p>Through the challenges I’m pleased with the final product and its appearance. I was able to apply different filtering techniques and am quite amazed at Photoshop’s ability to remove large items from and image and meld them into the background nearly seamlessly and also to isolate easily along edges. I wouldn’t call my final product comprehensive, in that it doesn’t explain how the individual components interact with each other. However, since most computers and microcontrollers share quite a few commonalities, it would help someone transfer their knowledge to identify basic components in a new system they would encounter.</p>
